OSU FILE FORMAT GUIDE
---
osu file format v9 - :\

[General] ------------
AudioFilename: Name of the file in the song file directory

AudioLeadIn: Millis before the music starts playing - does not affect hitbox timings

PreviewTime: ? (The point into the song that gets played in the menu? -Dave)

Countdown: Sets the timing of the countdown animation and sound before the first hitboxes appear - timing seems to be slower for 0 (off) to 2, with mod operations taking place for higher values

SampleSet: Types of sounds coming out of each successful hitbox strike

StackLeniency: [E] The higher the value, the more likely it is to snap together notes of further time-distance (2 to 10) - osu automatically stack these notes so adjusting this will auto stack these notes (I'm guessing for numerical ordering values)

Mode: [E] Osu can be played in a few different modes (keyboard, taiko, etc.) - this should force a mode - 0 is all modes

LetterboxInBreaks: True (1) or False (0) - the break sections will have letterboxing around them

SkinPreference: Overwrites the osu skin preferences - "Default" to use default osu skin, no section here if no preference

CountdownOffset: [E] The timing offset of the countdown. 0 to 2 - Not sure how it changes the values (think it's by the number of beats early according to E text?)

StoryFireInFront: [E] Have yet to see - Some animation that puts the storyboard with fire in front (0 if true, not in file if false) (Tsugaru does this? -Dave)

EpilepsyWarning: [E] Puts a warning before the song starts for flashing backgrounds (1 is on, not in file if false) - does not delay song, displays over intro


[Editor] ------------
(I think these are editor details only - what gives me that idea? :P)

DistanceSpacing: 0.8

BeatDivisor: 2

GridSize: 8


[Metadata] ------------
Title: Song Name - does not affect song selection (perhaps this is stored when beatmaps are first installed?)

Artist:RevenG vs DE-SIRE

Creator:Zelos

Version:Standard

[Difficulty] ------------
HPDrainRate: How fast your HP drains per miss and over time (max is 10) - amount of HP lost increases from 0 (still drains) to 10

CircleSize: Size of hit boxes - smaller is bigger - only seems to affect size, not position - smallest appears to be 10, any smaller stays at 10 (E allows 3-7, could be based on difficulty)

OverallDifficulty: [E] The harshness of the timing window; The difficulty of the spinners - 0 to 10, higher the harder

ApproachRate: How quickly the hitboxes appear on the screen - 10 is max, 0 is min, the larger, the faster they come - affects outer timing circles as well

SliderMultiplier: Changes the rate of speed of a given slider... O_o The higher it is, the faster the ball moves across the screen - 0 is lowest, 10 is hightest, game expects values between 0.5 or so and 3.4 or so

SliderTickRate: Divides sliders into this many components - points are awarded as you transition from one side to the other - 10 is max, 1 is lowest, anything else exhibits the properties of the values before hand


[Events] ------------
(VALUES ARE BELOW, not next to like the others)

//Background and Video events
[?],[?],[background-file-name-in-quotes]
5,5 breaks the song so it doesn't launch, 10,10 makes the background not show - don't think this is useful, filename is filename

//Break Periods
Break timings
[? - always 2 from what I have seen],[Start-time],[End-time]
Timings are in milliseconds - note these are not on the beats

//Storyboard Layer 0 (Background)
//Storyboard Layer 1 (Fail)
//Storyboard Layer 2 (Pass)
//Storyboard Layer 3 (Foreground)
//Storyboard Sound Samples
//Background Colour Transformations
[?,?,R,G,B]

?: Anything besides 3 seems to make the background color not appear in-game (but does appear in the menus)

?: No idea.

RGB: color values 0-255


[TimingPoints] ------------
([E] - Changing song temp and timings? [T] Seems to only affect slider speed and timings)

[Offset, BPM, Time Signature, SampleSet, SampleSetCustom, Vol, InheritPreviousTimings, KIAI]

Offset: Offset to start timing (millis)

BPM: bpm in some weird format - so 363.636363636364=165, 1000=60 BPM, 500=120BPM, etc.; non-inherited timings are this val, inherited seem to be multipliers ([E] says for slider velocity), -100 means no change, -133.3(repeating) is 75% & -66.6(repeating) is 150%

Time Signature: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 over 4 - don't know how this impacts the game

SampleSet: Changes the type of hits 

SampleSetCustom: Selects the custom sound set to associate

Vol: The volume of the hitbox hits at a given section

InheritPreviousTimings: Changes the inherited values - When 1, sets its own values, 0, it inherits. BPM is no longer a multiplier, and I think some other values become irrelevant

KIAI: Makes the section more epic by adding some flair or something, harder hits and icon popping up


[Colours] ------------
[Name# : B,R,G]

Names are "Combo#", colors are vals between 0-255 for each channel

Entire field and header disappears if custom colors are not enabled (get a default - theirs are green, blue, red, orange)


[HitObjects] ------------
[X, Y, Timing, PieceType, SoundType, TYPE-SPECIFIC]

X: x-position; 0-512, LR, anything more or less takes edge cases

Y: y-position; 0-384, TB, anything more went off-screen, less was fine - I was playing in widescreen, how does this affect the grid?

Timing: timing in millis

PieceType:
(New Combo specifies that the numbers should reset for a given value pair and that the colors should change to the next set)
	1 - Button
	5 - Button (New Combo)
	2 - Slider
	6 - Slider (New Combo)
	12 - Spinner

SoundType: Determines what sound should be played as this piece is activated
	0 - None
	2 - Whistle
	4 - Finish (bass & cymbol)
	8 - Clap
	6 - Whistle & finish
	12 - Finish & clap
	10 - Whistle & clap
	14 - Whistle, clap, & finish
- These are flags. So
	- Whistle = 0x0010
	- Finish  = 0x0100
	- Clap    = 0x1000
- Bitwise-and them together to get multiple at once

TYPE-SPECIFIC:
	Button - none
	Spinner - End time
	Sliders - B|x:y (for each part)|end_x:end_y,times repeated,SliderDistance,SoundTypeOnHit|Hit2|Hit3...
		SliderDistance - one beat is 100, anything less is less - not dependent on BPM - perhaps related to Bezier curves; slider velocity will increase this value (150 will be multiplier of 1.5 for 1 beat) - distance travelled in 1 beat, perhaps? NOTE: SLIDER AUTO-ADJUSTS POSITION BASED UPON BEATS - two different positions can have the same end result for the slider (bezier related?)
		SoundTypeOnHit seems to be the same format as above
		SoundType ignored for sliders
