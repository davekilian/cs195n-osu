- Hitting sliders along the length of the path

4) ---

- Immediately apparent how to play for him.
- Is doing well though sliders bothered him at first.
	- Misses the beginning but understands how to follow now.
- Spinners work again!

- Movements don't sync much with the movement
	- Not jamming out as he's playing

- "How do I select something?"
	- "I don't know what is selected."
	- "You created this to hurt my mind, didn't you?"

- "This is cool, I like it."
- "I'm not sure there is a strategy, though."
- "Are they random or…?"
- "Why does it keep showing me these X's? That's sad.
	- Failed twice now. :P
- "I'm just going to tap all of them, I don't care if I'm doing them in order." - started spazzing everything

10) ---

- Girls Generaiotn!
- Too hard to start
- Understands the components but obviously too hard
- "I don't even know what's going on anymore!"
- "Good thing there's no failing or I would have failed already!"
	- May want to add failing back in so people will stop playing the hard stuff :P
- Spinners make sense
- Not keeping in time because he's trying to hit all the notes first
- Doing pretty good besides that
- Not seeing the stacked buttons either
- Doing well in the slower sections
- Song goes on too long after song - me
- "Yay! F!"

13) ---
- Snide remarks at the tutorial… ^_^

- Not really following the idea of sliders…
- Chose a harder difficulty than he should have
- Followning along the idea of sliders now but starting too early
- Understood spin but didn't care enough to stop scratching his head…
- Not always hitting in order but doing fairly well
- Sliders are broken again for some reason… :(
- Tapping his foot along with the song…
- "Tutorial explained everything I needed to know."
	- "Little long"
- "Easy seemed very fast but easy… More forgiving but not less confusing… Not less frantic." - Played Deep Space. "Felt he could win but was still be being pulled in every direction."
	- "Could be fewer."

14) ---
- Tutorial!
- "Oh… This is like that DS game…"
- "Instructions are a little lengthy…"
- Screen turned off.
- "I'm assuming the blinky thing means that's what's selected…"
	- "Oh, the thing in the middle of the screen that is selected…"
- "Progress bars!"
- Sliders are still boned… :\
- Understands buttons. Understood sliders after a while.
- "This is easy?"
- "Thumb gets in the way"
- Everything seems to make sense to him though it seems that it's a bit harder than he would have liked for a first song.
- Not happy with a B!
- "When I missed it, I felt the X was delayed to show it."

15) ---
- I like the little logo thingie!
- No tutorial!
- "How many songs do you have?"
- "There are like three of everything."
- First Tsugaru.
- "Not obvious how to select anything."
- "Am I missing?"
- "SPIN! NOOOO! WHICH WAY DO I SPIN?"
- Best playtester so far. Really knows what he's doing and ow to manipulate everything. O_o
- Despite the fact he chose a hard map.
- Repetitions are hurting him on the sliders.
- "This is so hard."
- He wants some type of feedback to make it seem like you hit it on the back.

16) ---
- In Ratty. It's loud. :\
- It makes the selected one go invisible, but I feel it should be the other way around
- No tutorial.
- It doesn't appear to be making sound - probably too loud
- What does the decreasing bar mean?
- Got spinners.
- "When you drag, it doesn't move very quickly."
- "Does that mean back?"
- "When you drag, it seems slow. It doesn't really follow your finger."
- Sound is on now. Volume was down… :\
- Seems to be doing fairly well.
- Didn't understand the stacked button design.
- "The circles should pop when you click on them."
	- "Not clear when you are successful."
- "I don't think you need the tap to start splash screen."

17) ---
- A natural here.
- "Hard mode is hard."
- He's doing he really well and understands everything.
- Totally has played before.
- Sliders are too ridiculous. :P
- "The response time is awkward."
- "There should be an indicator of whether I hit or not."
- "Instead of appearing and disappearing, a highlight bar might be more intuitive."
- "Is there a back button to the main menu?"
	- lol, no… :(
- "That bar on the top, is that supposed to be your health bar?"
	- "Should be the amount of time remaining in the song. It would be more helpful than stressing about you health. Either that or a timer but a timer would be distracting"

18) ---
- "I am being welcomed to osu!"
- "I was expected to have a button done as an example here."
	- During tutorial
- Obviously bored by the tutorial again
- "Hmmming"
- "I would have liked to have portions with a certain direction and you get a chance to try it at that point, or even a little video."
- Didn't seem to mind the tutorial's length as much.
- "Easy… why not?"
- .59 easy
- Hitting beats early
	- Slider on .59 fucked up again
- Knew what to do for the spinner.
- Slider is balls on .59
- Moving along sliders too quickly
- "Once you get into the flow of things, it makes a lot more sense."
- Still moving sliders a bit too quickly.
- Not understanding the repeated sliders.
- "Some of the slides, I don't have as much control over."
- Input response felt solid.
- Seems to managing the song selection fine.
- 2nd song is much more difficult. Seems a it perplexed.
- This game is starting soop awkward.
- May be holding the game funnily as he is the first to be using headphones.
- Sliders are becoming really ridiculous for him at this rate.
- "I like the layout of stuff. And the rhythm which stuff comes in."
- Going for three! Tsugaru.
	- Chose one of the harder versions. Looks frustrated. Perhaps too hard.
- "It's fun. Very playful."
	- Too cluttered.
- "It seems appreciative with rhythm - particularly with D&B tracks."

19) ---
- Doing the tutorial
- "Should you use multiple fingers?"
- Let the device go to sleep during the tutorial… x_x
- "I'll try playing the game."
- .59 easy.
- "I don't actually know what I am doing."
- Figured out the buttons but he is hitting them early.
- Tapping the sliders.
- Took him until interlude to understand sliders
- "I don't know what to do with the slider things.
	- Since I think the sliders are broken in this song.
- Spinners are readily apparent
	"I like the spin thing."
- Doing the tutorial again.
- "Buttons need to be tapped… Do they need to be tapped in rhythm?"
- "Is there one where the sliders aren't broken?"
	- x_x
- "How come it didn't make me lose before?"
	- Tee hee hee, too easy.
- "It would be better if you showed images for what's going on with the tutorial."
- Tsugaru for two.
- "This is pretty cool."
- "The slider works."
- "Yeah, this makes a lot more sense after reading the tutorial."
- Seems to be doing much better now.
- "This is awesome music."
- "Spin faster damn it!"

20) ---
- Tutorial
	- Tried to click to advance the screen
	- Feels there should be something at the top of the screen during the tutorial.
	- Looks bored. :\
	- Said the tutorial is a long thing.
- "Calibrate!"
- Understood the slider at first - buttons were fine and in time
- Did the spinner fine but tried to spin in towards the center
- Seems to have made it through the song well enough.
- "This game is neat!"
- "It might be nice to have the songs on one screen and the difficulties on another screen."

21) ---
- No tutorial
- Making sense at first
- "Oh it's elite beat thingie."
- "Okay, I can't… What is this, I don't even…"
- "Oh, I keep forgetting the repeat."
- "When does this end? Just tell me I fail already."
- "Some of them are drawn off-screen."
- Moving along sliders way too quickly.
	- Just dragging along instead of staying in time
		- Should have sound effect reinforcment.
- Seems to be having the difficulty with some of the timing elements.

22) ---
- Tutorial - trying to tap to advance
	- Slow and steady wins the race
	- "There are a lot of rules."

	- "I don't remember most of these rules but okay."
- .59 didn't see difficulty.
- Isn't sure what to do on sliders.
- Spinner good
- Hitting the buttons in time well.
- Broken ass sliders :\
- Still not sure what to do with sliders
- Tapping the start of sliders and not continuing along with the rest of it.
- Starting to understand sliders.
- "Huh."
- "Took a while to understand what I was supposed to do."
- "I like the numbers on the things."
- Tried to tap to select a song.
- Deep Space for 2.
- Seems amused. :P
- Understands the sliders entirely now, it seems.
- Almost understood the stacking.
- Sliders are stacking and she seems to be having difficulty.
- The break sections are a bit boring without feedback - me.
- Seems to be doing really well now.
- "I don't like the spinny thing. I don't really get the point of that."
- "The sliding doesn't really seem to respond."

23) ---
- Going to get everyone sick who uses this now, lol.
- Tutorial
	- Trying to click to advance
	- … still trying…
	- Getting bored
	- "Come on…!"
	- "That's why I never do tutorials in games."
- Deep Space.
- Tapping sliders to start them, not following along them.
- "Damn, this is hard."
- Hitting the buttons in time farily well though.
- It's hard because you need good timing, you can't just hit them as fast as you can.
- Trying to hold the start of sliders now and hit the other button at the end.
- Whistling with the music ^_^
- Spinner good
- Doesn't look like he's going to figure out sliders.
- Still holding down the sliders…
- "It's too fast passed for me to… uh. yeah."
- "The sliders threw me off though."

24) ---
- Tutorial - trying to tap to advance.
	- "I wonder why it's not using the whole screen."
	- "I would to to tap after I finish reading."
	- "Doesn't seem like there's a way to exit the tutorial, I feel like I have the information I need."
- "The Na's songs, the name is long I can't see the difficulty."
- "I would like to be able to tap on the name to play rather than hit the play button."
- Deep Space… again.
- Doesn't get sliders at first.
- "Not sure if easy is how I would describe that."
- Starting sliders early, not following the nub.
- Spinners work again!
- Seems confused by the break!
- Seems to be doing fairly well now though - I think he got sliders (hard to see - his hand is in the way)
- "I could see the X's when I miss stuff but the sliders really felt like I could really mess them up and it would still work."
	- "It wouldn't give me an X. It felt like it should."
- Song two.
- Na na na na na na
- Seems to be doing fairly well now.
- Not really doing the sliders in time anymore.
- Is starting to tap everywhere x_x
- "Seems to work too well. I can just randomly well and not die."
	- "Used to guitar hero and DDR where you need to do things like you know them, even on the easy settings."
- "Found out you can randomly tap and still do well - no punishment."
- "I haven't figured out how to do the sliders correctly."

25) ---
- Tutorial.
	- "It would be nice if you showed the objects you are talking about in the tutorial."
	- "Turn off the sleep."
	- Wants to use back to end the tutorial, not the game
	- Did it.
- Tried to tap to enter a song.
- Understood the hit circles properly.
- Hitting the sliders in time instead of dragging
- Spinners work again!
- Not sure which direction to spin
- Seems to understand slider repetitions
- Seems to be doing pretty well now, in general.
- Recognized "Elite Beat Agents"
- .59, then Na na na na
- Chose a really hard one. Is kind've spazzing
	- "I don't know! I don't know!"
- Is tapping randomly… he found our secret… :P
- Stopped the song :\
- "Show the objects on the tutorial as I have no idea what you mean by button or slider until I see them."
- "The slider, not quite sure I understood how it worked - nothing from the game told me I was doing it right. Same thing with the button presses not sure if I did it right."

26) ---
- Tutorial.
	- "Cool…"
	- "Button, sliders, and spinners… sound complicated."
	- "I would like it to go a little faster."
	- "I would like to have a next button in the tutorial."
	- Tapping the screen a lot to make it go faster. :(
	- Seems to be getting quite bored.
	- Big sigh.
- Tapped the song to select.
	- And move the screen despite dragging before.
- Deep Space… *sigh*
- Trying to tap as the song is starting.
- CHose a hard difficulty.
- Starting to understand
- "Is that my health?"
- Sort of understood the spinner
- Hitting the buttons a little early
- Jamming out! b(^_^o)
- Wasn't sure if the rings were at all related to the BPM of the song.
- Moving along the sliders too fast.
- Started to learn and do well by the end then.
- 2nd song… na na nan an naanananananaa
- Started on an okay hard one
- Hitting things early since he is not following along with the sliders
- Hitting the different points of the sliders rather than following along it.
- Tapping to start exclusively now for sliders
- Hitting things too late now - out of time
- Putting the device down - seems to be getting bored and/or tired.
- Just tapping sliders instead of following along them.
- Suggests that it takes a long time for the ring to get there. Instinct is to hit it when he sees motion but he has to wait. For 16th, too much going on at the same time.

27) ---
- Tutorial.
	- Tapped to advance.
	- Chuckled. :P
	- "Huh. I guess I'll find out!"
	- Seems to be reading it well enough.
	- Going on for a long time though.
	- "I'm not going to keep track of any of this. I think if there's something that showed what the game would look like during the tutorial."
	- "It would make sense if I read this after I played it." O_o
- .59
- Hitting the beats a little early
- Not really understaning the sliders or the temirs
- Fine with spinner/on top of the beats now.
- "Oh, I see" - about halfway through the song about buttons
- Not really getting the repetitions on sliders
- Tapped to select a song.
- Deep space for 2nd
- Having difficulty staying on top of the tempo
- Getting a bit frustrated with this it seems
- "I'm not sure if I'm hitting them… I'm not getting as bad X's as I was before which is…"
- Seems to be doing pretty well now.
- Got through to the end pretty well.
- 3rd song. Tsugaru.
- Doing pretty well here.
- Having difficulty with the layered ones… :\
- Didn't get the stacking but I think he understood why.
	- "When I don't see the numbers, I guess I should just hit twice."
- "That was cool"
	- "I can see that one is good if I had played it before."
- He felt it was to tell if he was "getting hit" - it would light up when you did it.
	- "I was hitting it and asking if I was hitting it right?"
- No real positive reinforcements.

28) ---
- Tutorial
	- Started looking away… must be getting bored. :P
	- "Alright…" Seems to be getting bored with the tutorial.
	- "Lower difficulty, what is that?"
- Trying to tap to select the song.
	- Explains, says it's whatever is in the center.
- "Where are the buttons?" as the song starts.
- Chose a harder difficulty.
- Seems to be having trouble with sliders - just holding down the starting button.
- The buttons are fine though
- Still just tapping sliders.
- Still has not tried sliding the slider - sees no reason not to.
- Has started to try sliding sliders - but has decided to stop
- My wrist hurts. x_x
- Of course, repetitions are not fazing him.
- "Cool, really cool. I've played a different version of the game."

29) ---
- Skipped tutorial
- Cluttered
- Not really paying attention to numbers, different visual cue?
- Would prefer some sort of immediate feedback based on performance
- Americans probably see S as satisfactory (i.e. less than A), though S is A in Japanese grading (where S comes from)
