Hello,

Some friendly notes for setting up our game on other devices for demo day:

- In the root of this handin is a folder called bin/ containing Osu.apk. 
  We don't have another device to test this on, but theoretically you should
  be able to install this using adb install just like any other APK.

- In the interest of time, we've handed in one of our eclipse workspaces as
  is, without changing it to work on departmental systems. This means that you
  won't be able to compile another copy of our game. Even if you fix Eclipse,
  you'll probably also need to install the NDK and then do some Makefile kung
  fu. If adb install doesn't work, let us know and we'll work with you to 
  attempt to find a workaround on short notice. 

- We felt it was logical to place beatmaps on external storage both to make
  compilation/deployment times not insane and to make it easy for a user to
  edit their device's beatmaps. Unfortunately, this means just installing the
  APK alone will lead to our game not being very fun.
  
  When installing our game, please mount the device's internal storage (you
  can do this by sliding down the notifications tab, selecting "USB 
  connected", and then following the instructions). Once you have done this,
  please copy the contents of the assets/beatmaps/ directory of this handin to a
  folder on the device storage called /osu/beatmaps. So, for example, 
  handin:/assets/beatmaps/tsugaru should end up in
  device:/osu/beatmaps/tsugaru

Thanks for your help :)

-Dave and Mike
