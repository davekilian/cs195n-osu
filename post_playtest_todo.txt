The list
X Remove taiko maps
X Slider problems (bezierUpper sometimes > 1?)
X End a beatmap when there are no controls left (unhandled an on-deck lists are both empty)
X Engine mod: don't let the screen turn off
X Tutorial tap-through (to next slide, e.g.)
X No health drain during breaks
X Custom int-to-string to avoid GC activity -_-
- Tutorial images
- Snare on button hits
- Snare on sliders ended, if the user didn't miss them entirely
- Drumroll on slider being held, stop when finger lifted or slider ended
- Some type of sound for spinners
- Replace some of the eh beatmaps
- Handle different sound types
- Break-timing letterboxes
- Particle-system effects when stuff is hit
- Recoloring effects when stuff is hit

Stop at 11:00 and do these:
- Brag slide
- Installation instructions for TAs

TODO
These are ordered sequentially in terms of importance with respect to time. The numbers are ordered for general overall importance if we had all the time in the world. Keep in mind these are general and done quickly.

- (1) Take off Taiko maps!!!
- (9) Turn off sleep ability
- (6) Tutorial Duration
	- Shorten tutorial! Or make it advance faster.
	- Next button in tutorial (just tap screen to advance)
- (5) Objects in the tutorial (just images)
- (8) Don't let you tap randomly
- (7) Beatmap cleanup
	- Deep space easy difficulty is harder than expected
	- Na na na na (name length and says fuck?)
	- New songs/better maps
- (10) Affirmative in break sections
- (3) More reinforcement for sliders so people know what to do with them.
- (4) Feedback on correct hits?
	- (HAPTIC LOL)
	- Splash on buttons
- (2) Fix broken sliders

THINGS I AM UNSURE ABOUT
- Are there songs that don't end after the beatmap does (I think there is one or two on there)
- Are X's delayed?
- Make it harder? - Seems to be bad for playtesting
